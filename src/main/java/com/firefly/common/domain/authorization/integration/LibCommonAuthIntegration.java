 * Integration interface for lib-common-auth authorization system.
 * 
 * This interface provides a bridge between the CQRS authorization system
 * and the lib-common-auth library, allowing for seamless integration when
 * lib-common-auth is available in the classpath.
 * 
 * The integration supports:
 * - Automatic detection of lib-common-auth annotations on commands/queries
 * - Integration with lib-common-auth AccessValidator system
 * - Zero-trust architecture with custom authorization overrides
 * - Fallback to custom authorization when lib-common-auth is not available
