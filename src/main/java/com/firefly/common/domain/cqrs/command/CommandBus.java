/**
 * Interface for the Command Bus in CQRS architecture.
 *
 * <p>The Command Bus is responsible for routing commands to their appropriate handlers
 * and provides the central mechanism for command processing in the domain layer.
 * It follows the mediator pattern to decouple command senders from command handlers.
 *
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Automatic handler discovery and registration</li>
 *   <li>Reactive command processing with Mono return types</li>
 *   <li>Support for correlation context propagation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Service
 * public class OrderService {
 *     private final CommandBus commandBus;
 *
 *     public Mono<OrderResult> createOrder(CreateOrderRequest request) {
 *         CreateOrderCommand command = new CreateOrderCommand(request.getItems());
 *         return commandBus.send(command);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
